👋 Hi, I’m @DanielBashary I am a software engineer, who is passionate about computer science and the impact it has on the world. As a strategic and creative developer, I can effectively manage projects from start to end. I am your “go-to” choice to build solutions and features to address your organization’s complex problems.

My focus over the last several years has been on programming using Java, C#, HTML, CSS, SQL, and other languages. So far, I have applied these skills to the financial technology and real estate spaces, however I am always curious to learn about other industries.

I am seeking a new Software Engineer opportunity where I can use my skills to make a real and meaningful difference. Here’s why you want me on your team:
⭐I am extremely dedicated, trustworthy, and reliable.
⭐I am a true team player with the confidence and expertise to work independently.
⭐I’m a quick learner, picking up new tools on the go. I am persistent and never give up when presented with a new challenge.
⭐Hard-working is an understatement. I will crank out tasks until the job is done perfectly.

Feel free to take a look at my projects on my Github. I am always open to new connections, and can be reached by phone at +972 (053) 754-3035 or by email at daniel.bashary@gmail.com.
